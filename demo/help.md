# folio help

Everything in folio is one Markdown document: prose, typed tables,
and charts generated from them. This help page is itself a folio
document — written in the same renderer you are working with.

## Views and sections

- **Document view** is the rendered report. Click into any text and
  type; table formulas recalculate as you edit.
- The block and format buttons (H1, H2, P, B, I, code) always show
  where you are: the button for the block or format at your caret
  lights up — in Document view and in Markdown view alike. In
  Markdown view the buttons also work on the source: H1 prefixes the
  line, B wraps the selection (or word) in `**`.
- **Markdown view** (toolbar toggle) shows the source with syntax
  highlighting. Switch back to Document to re-parse. If a parse
  error appears, fix the reported line — folio stays in source view
  until the Markdown is valid.
- **☰ Sections** toggles the outline sidebar. Click a section to
  jump straight to it.

## Opening and saving

- **Desktop app:** the Open button (folder icon) loads a .md file
  from disk; Save (arrow-down icon) writes the current document to
  a file you choose.
- **Web:** switch to Markdown view and copy the source — the plain
  Markdown text is the document.

## Tables and charts

- The table button (grid icon in the toolbar) inserts a typed table
  at the cursor.
- Charts are not widgets — they are queries over a table. Edit the
  table and the figure updates on the next render. There is no run
  button anywhere in folio, and no execution state.

The help window is always one press away: the **? Help** toolbar
button, or the **?** key when you are not typing.
